# 🛑 Hate Speech Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project builds a Natural Language Processing (NLP) based Machine Learning model to detect hate speech in textual data. The objective is to classify text into categories such as hate speech, offensive language, or neutral content.

The project follows an end-to-end ML pipeline including text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and performance evaluation.

##  Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of text samples (e.g., social media posts or comments) labeled into categories such as:

- Hate Speech
- Offensive Language
- Neutral Content

The goal is to train a classifier that can automatically detect harmful content.

---

##  Objectives

- Clean and preprocess textual data
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Convert text into numerical features
- Train classification models
- Evaluate model performance

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / Text Processing Libraries
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Machine Learning Workflow

1. Text Cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal)
2. Tokenization
3. Feature Extraction (TF-IDF / Count Vectorization)
4. Train-Test Split
5. Model Training (Decision Tree Classifier)
6. Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score)

---

##  Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics used:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

Accuracy-89.1
